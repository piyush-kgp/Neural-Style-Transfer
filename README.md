# neural-style
This repository contains the server-side code for my app that does Neural Style Transfer using deep CNNs, as mentioned in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf) by Gatys et al., 2015.

Deep learning framework used: [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org)

CNN architecture used: [VGG19](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf), Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015. The weights can be obtained from [here](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/).
